- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin. I am a student at Georgia Tech, majoring in Computer Science, who has an interest in Software Engineering, Finance, and Entrepreneurship.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining experience through internships and developing software that will help make people's lives better. 
- 🌱 I’m proficient in C++, and I'm currently further developing my Java skills. I plan to familiarize myself with one or two more languages. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects/tasks that are for beginners/intermediates, and of course, want to meet more people.
