Hey! Iâ€™m Kevin, a Computer Science major concentrating in Intelligence and Networks at Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently searching for software development internships for Spring and Summer 2023.

Iâ€™m proficient in Java (with its data structures and algorithms) and have previous project experience with C++, C, and some familiarity with Python, HTML, Docker, Git, etc. I am looking to learn new ideas and tools that will be useful in the industry and in a collaborative environment.

Some of my personal interest and hobbies include basketball, badminton, and exploring Eurasia. Iâ€™m currently picking up an instrument and am trying to be fluent in Spanish.
